This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring web pages (click the **Help** toolbar button for more details on using R Markdown).

When you click the **Knit HTML** button a web page will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
setwd("~/Documents/Princeton/Academics/Junior Spring/IndependentWork/");
data = read.csv("testIBMMSFTAAPL.csv", header=TRUE);
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r fig.width=7, fig.height=6}

```
