# Spring-2015-IW
This is Saahil Madge's Junior Independent Work conducted in Spring 2015. The actual code used is contained in the file 'techsectoranalysis.py'. The other python files are simply testing files used to become familiar with the pandas and sklearn python libraries. The CSV files contain the financial data. The one used in the project is called 'techsectordatareal.csv', whereas the other datasets were used in previous iterations of the projects or are missing some elements.

The 'Paper' folder contains the written report.
